Indoor growing light and airflow management.
ESP 32 DEV KIT
DHT22 SENSOR X 3
X2 RELAY MODULE X 3
PLATFORMIO ON VSCODE

The code is pretty simple and its focused on sensing Temperature and  Relative Humidity (with DHT22 sensors),
and controlling the ON/OFF light and fan cycles with the use of relay modules.

I look forward to make it more user-friendly and web-controlling for a most styled-base experience.

Until I manage to get it to work fully, Ill be commiting several changes with no proper documentation for testing means.
After that I promise that every commit will be fully detailed.
